# Worksheet 1: Getting Started with TypeScript

**Due: Monday, January 24, 11:59pm CDT**

For the conceptual worksheets in this course, we will provide a Markdown template in a repository that will be created for you through GitHub classroom.  You can clone this repository, directly edit your local copy with your answers, and then commit and push the file to complete the submission.  Alternatively, you can use GitHub's built-in Markdown editor and edit directly on your repository website without having to clone it locally.  If you are unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, then you can check out this [lovely guide provided by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) before you get started.

*Do not make a copy of the provided Markdown template and submit that instead.* Our grading scripts will be looking for `README.md` within the root folder of your repository.  You should modify this template directly without changing the filename.

## Background

If you are new to TypeScript, you should familiarize yourself by reading the following chapters from the official handbook:

- [The Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)
- [Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)
- [Narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html)

Some of this information might appear pretty basic, but you will learn a lot about how TypeScript assigns static types to variables, objects, and functions and how it evaluates code execution paths to enforce strong typing.  You will also get a nice introduction to the syntax and pick up some handy tricks that are unique to this language, so don't skip them!
